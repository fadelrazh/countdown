## Deploy on Netlify

You can deploy your Next.js app easily with Netlify. Follow these steps:

1. **Create a Production Build**:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   # or
   yarn build
   # or
   pnpm build
   # or
   bun build
   ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify**:

   - Create an account on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) if you haven't already.
   - Go to the Netlify dashboard and click on "New site from Git".
   - Connect your GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket repository.
   - Configure the build settings:
     - Build command: `npm run build` or appropriate command (`yarn build`, `pnpm build`, `bun build`).
     - Publish directory: `out` (or `public`, depending on your Next.js configuration).

3. **Set Environment Variables** (if needed):

   - If your project requires environment variables, configure them in the Netlify dashboard under "Site settings" > "Build & deploy" > "Environment".
   - For local development, use `.env.local` file in your project's root directory.

4. **Deploy Your Site**:
   - Netlify will build and deploy your site automatically.
   - Once deployed, you'll get a unique URL to access your live site.
